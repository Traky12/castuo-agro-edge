> **Offline-first rural edge computing stack for agritech and environmental monitoring.**

---

## 1. Purpose & Scope
**castuo-agro-edge** is the operational edge layer of the ecosystem. It is designed to run in environments where connectivity is unreliable, sovereignty matters, and telemetry must survive disconnections.

Its scope covers:
- **MQTT Telemetry Ingestion:** Local sensor data handling.
- **Offline Buffering:** Data persistence during disconnection periods.
- **Hardware Integration:** Support for Raspberry Pi gateways and ESP32 nodes.
- **Edge Orchestration:** Sensor management and local actuation loops.

---

## 2. Ecosystem Position
castuo-agro-edge acts as the **EDGE** layer, providing field evidence and telemetry to the core platform.

## 3. Technology Stack
| Layer | Technology |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Gateway** | Python 3.11+, FastAPI |
| **Messaging** | MQTT (Mosquitto) |
| **Buffer** | SQLite / TimescaleDB (edge) |
| **Hardware** | Raspberry Pi, ESP32, LoRaWAN |
| **Containers** | Docker, Compose |
| **AI (optional)** | Mistral AI EU |

## 4. Engineering & Evidence
Following the **Evidence-First** principle, this repository focuses on providing reproducible field data.
- **Implemented:** MQTT ingestion, local buffering, and Pi gateway support.
- **Planned:** Full end-to-end synchronization with GaiaChain/Core.

Maturity is tracked through the **G0-G7 Gates** in the governance plane (`castuo-evolution`).
